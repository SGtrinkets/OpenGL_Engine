This project is mainly just for the purpose of learning OpenGL. Whether a game or an engine is made out of this eventually, I have no answer to that.



Trying to learn as much as possible through the concepts and not just from the code so that when talking about other concepts related to graphics
programming, I will have at least some idea of what I'm talking about.

Might make a few demos in other branches on the side.



Textbook being used as a guide through this process:
